(Each cell will have one number, the slope from 1985-2021; color coded – red hotter and drier, blue – wetter and cooler) We will refer to these as the “historical trend maps.” What patterns do you observe? In other words, where are areas getting more(less) wet (dry) or hot (cool)? Pick two regions exhibiting either large increases or decreases in T or P. Based on what you know about these areas, are these patterns consistent with what you would expect due to predicted climate change dynamics and/or land-use?\n"

Calculate the monthly climatology for T and P for the full historical record and the recent record. Plot the T climatologies for the historical and recent periods in a single plot and repeat for the P climatologies in a single plot. Comment on the historical and recent climatologies for T and P separately. Is each variable experiencing similar variability between the two time periods? Are T and P exhibiting similar differences to one another between the time periods? How might climate change be impacting the differences between the historical and recent periods?"
