We will analyze the oldest CO2 monitoring station data with the goal of understanding: how/why is the concentration of CO2 changing in the atmosphere?\n","\n","The goal of this assignment: to answer the question: How/why does the concentration of CO2 change at Mauna Loa? Be as quantitative as you can be in your answers. To do this we need to figure out what the key parameters are that are impacting the concentration of CO2. And to do this, we have available sensor data. It’s up to you to figure out what to do with them, and how to analyze the data to answer the question.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DiQmWq8_knzl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Datasets:\n","For this assignment, you will be using the Mauna Loa Carbon Dioxide dataset.  This dataset was collected from 1958 to the present day. It is the longest running carbon dioxide measurement station in the world. The longevity of this dataset allows us to get a good picture of the changes in our carbon cycle with the advance of climate change.\n","\n","This dataset contains columns for the month and year that the data were taken. We will not be using these columns except to construct the date at the beginning of our program. This construction is included in the cell that loads the data.\n","\n","This dataset also contains multiple columns that contain CO<sub>2</sub> information.\n","\n","The monthly averaged data (monthly_average_co2) is the average or mean of the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration values at the Mauna Loa observation site over each month. For example there is a data point for January 1959 and a data point for February 1959. These data points do not just represent one reading, which would be more susceptable to daily and even hourly variations, but are instead the averages of all of the measurements made during that month.\n","\n","The other CO<sub>2</sub> data available to us from this dataset is the \"de-seasonalized\" data (de-seasonalized_co2). There is an oscillation present in the monthly averaged data happens once per year as a result of seasonal variations. We can use various averaging schemes to remove this seasonal variation in our signal in order to see the overall long term trend more clearly. This cleaning/filtering process has been performed on the data and included in the dataset as a column named 'de-seasonalized_co2'.\n","\n","\n","If you want to learn more about this dataset see: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"24m5SiefbLdY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Units:\n","The unit for reporting CO2 is parts per million (ppm).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NjdsVotcb2d0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Toolbox:\n","All the Python functions and packages you will use in this assignment are in the toolbox for the course.

This week you will consider how best to interpret your data and use some simple analysis tools.*\n","\n","● *become motivated to think about new sensors and new ways of using sensor data to study the planet.
