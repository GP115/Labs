We will do in the classroom with hand-held sensors, what NASA is attempting to do from satellites, with the goal of understanding: how/why is the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> changing?\n",

To do this we need to figure out what the key parameters are that are impacting the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. And to do this, we have available sensors. It’s up to you to figure out what to do with them, when and where to measure, and how to analyze the data to answer the question.\n"

    "- Become familiar with the wide range of sensors available to study various components of the Earth system. These include sensors on satellites, aircraft, ground-based platforms, and deployed above or beneath the surface on land or water. *This week we will work with sensors and learn how these measurements can be made on a range of platforms from hand-held to satellites.*\n",
    "-  Become familiar with the basic physical principles (resolution, sampling, processing workflows, etc.) common to all sensors. *This week you will think about the impact of spatial and temporal sampling - the spatial and temporal frequency of measurements - on your data. You will use a very simple workflow to go from data to analysis.*\n",
    "- Work with various sources of data, learning how to access, analyze, synthesize, and describe the data to quantify trends; think critically and creatively about how to project these trends into the future. *This week you will consider how best to interpret your data and use some simple analysis tools.*\n"
